        "github.com/jlubawy/go-boilerpipe"
        "github.com/jlubawy/go-boilerpipe/extractor"
    )

    // Must provide an io.Reader (e.g. http.Response.Body) and an option *url.URL
    // which helps to extract a date for the article.
    doc, err := boilerpipe.NewDocument(r io.Reader, u *url.URL)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    extractor.Article().Process(doc)

    fmt.Println(doc.Title)
    fmt.Println(doc.URL) // normalized URL which can be used to test for URL equality
    fmt.Println(doc.Date)
    fmt.Print(doc.Content())
